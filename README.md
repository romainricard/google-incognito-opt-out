## How it works

When a new private Firefox window is created, it checks if specific Google cookies are set. If they are not, it creates them with values that make it opt-out of Google tracking... I guess. It's a mess. But hey, at least, the prompt is no longer displayed.

## Limitations

- For now, works only for `google.com`, not other Google TLDs.
